# Droidcon-Run
This is a simple runner game concept to show how easy it is to make a game.

"Droidcon Run" was made to be subject of study during the workshop "Unity for Android : Tips and tricks to consider before submitting to the Google Play Store" of DROIDCON TUNISIA 2016.

The game was made in a couple of hours, in a very simple way (barely playable) , just the way any beginner in unity would make, and demonstrated during the workshop how easy it is to check all issues that can occur and to go through the steps required to finally publish it to the play store, just to show you guys how easy it is to do this!

Feel free to edit the game as you please! actually show me what you did with it, send me an email brahim.hadriche@esprit.tn !
